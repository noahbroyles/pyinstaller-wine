# pyinstaller-wine
## A short python program for creating Windows exe's with Pyinstaller on Linux using Wine

I got this baby hooked up in PyCharm as an [external tool](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-third-party-tools.html):

I highly reccomend _not_ using this because Wine does a shitty job of including dependencies with `Pyinstaller`.
